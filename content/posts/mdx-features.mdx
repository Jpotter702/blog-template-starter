# MDX Features and Components

MDX combines the best of Markdown and React, allowing you to write content with the simplicity of Markdown while having the power of React components when you need them.

## What is MDX?

MDX is a format that lets you use JSX in your Markdown content. You can import components, such as interactive charts or alerts, and embed them within your content.

## Basic Markdown Features

All standard Markdown features are supported:

### Headings

You can use all heading levels from H1 to H6.

### Text Formatting

You can make text **bold**, *italic*, or `code`. You can also use ~~strikethrough~~ text.

### Lists

Unordered lists:
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

Ordered lists:
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

### Links and Images

You can add [links](https://example.com) and images:

![Sample Image](https://via.placeholder.com/600x300)

### Code Blocks

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet("World"));
```

```css
.example {
  color: #3b82f6;
  font-size: 1.125rem;
  font-weight: 600;
}
```

### Tables

| Feature | Supported | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| Headers | ‚úÖ | H1-H6 |
| Lists | ‚úÖ | Ordered and unordered |
| Code | ‚úÖ | Inline and blocks |
| Tables | ‚úÖ | Like this one |

### Blockquotes

> This is a blockquote. It can be used for emphasizing important information or quoting other sources.

## Advanced Features

### Math Support

You can add math equations using LaTeX syntax (when properly configured):

```
E = mc^2
```

### Syntax Highlighting

Code blocks automatically get syntax highlighting based on the language specified:

```typescript
interface BlogPost {
  title: string;
  date: string;
  content: string;
}

const post: BlogPost = {
  title: "My Blog Post",
  date: "2024-01-15",
  content: "This is my blog post content."
};
```

### Horizontal Rules

You can add horizontal rules to separate content:

## React Components in MDX

One of the most powerful features of MDX is the ability to use React components directly in your content. This template includes several pre-built components for common use cases.

### Custom Components

You can create custom components and use them in your MDX files. For example, if you had a `Button` component:

```jsx
<Button variant="primary" size="lg">
  Click me!
</Button>
```

### Interactive Content

Since you can use React components, you can create interactive content like:

- Interactive charts and graphs
- Embedded forms
- Custom UI elements
- Dynamic content

## Best Practices

1. **Keep it simple** - Use Markdown for content, React for interactivity
2. **Performance** - Be mindful of component bundle size
3. **Accessibility** - Ensure your components are accessible
4. **SEO** - Remember that complex components might not be SEO-friendly

## Conclusion

MDX provides a powerful way to create rich, interactive content while maintaining the simplicity of Markdown. This template gives you everything you need to start creating amazing blog posts with MDX.
