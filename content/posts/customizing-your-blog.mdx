# Customizing Your Blog Design

One of the great features of this blog template is how easy it is to customize. Everything is configured through the `site.config.ts` file, making it simple to change colors, fonts, and layout without touching the code.

## Theme Configuration

The theme configuration is located in `src/lib/site.config.ts`. Here's what you can customize:

### Typography

```typescript
typography: {
  fontFamily: {
    sans: ["Inter", "system-ui", "sans-serif"],
    serif: ["Georgia", "serif"],
    mono: ["JetBrains Mono", "monospace"],
  },
  fontSize: {
    xs: "0.75rem",
    sm: "0.875rem",
    base: "1rem",
    lg: "1.125rem",
    xl: "1.25rem",
    "2xl": "1.5rem",
    "3xl": "1.875rem",
    "4xl": "2.25rem",
    "5xl": "3rem",
  },
}
```

### Colors

```typescript
colors: {
  brand: {
    primary: "#3b82f6",
    secondary: "#6b7280",
    accent: "#10b981",
  },
  content: {
    primary: "#171717",
    secondary: "#6b7280",
    muted: "#9ca3af",
    inverse: "#ffffff",
  },
}
```

### Layout

```typescript
spacing: {
  header: "6rem",
  container: "2rem",
  section: "4rem",
  component: "1.5rem",
}
```

## Adding Custom Components

You can create custom MDX components by editing the `src/components/mdx-components.tsx` file. For example, to add a custom callout component:

```typescript
// Add to your MDX components
Callout: ({ children, type = "info" }) => (
  <div className={`p-4 rounded-lg border-l-4 ${
    type === "warning" ? "border-yellow-500 bg-yellow-50" :
    type === "error" ? "border-red-500 bg-red-50" :
    "border-blue-500 bg-blue-50"
  }`}>
    {children}
  </div>
),
```

## Styling Tips

- Use CSS custom properties for consistent theming
- Leverage Tailwind's utility classes for rapid development
- Consider dark mode support from the start
- Test your design on different screen sizes

## Advanced Customization

For more advanced customization, you can:

1. **Modify the CSS** in `src/app/globals.css`
2. **Add custom components** in `src/components/`
3. **Extend the Tailwind configuration** with custom utilities
4. **Add new pages** in the `src/app/` directory

Remember to test your changes thoroughly and maintain good accessibility practices!
