# How to Add Images to Your Blog Posts

Adding images to your blog posts makes them more engaging and helps illustrate your points. This guide covers everything you need to know about working with images in this blog template.

## 📸 Featured Images & Open Graph

First, let's talk about **featured images** - these are the thumbnails that appear when someone shares your blog post on social media (Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.). This is called **Open Graph** functionality.

### Setting a Featured Image

Add an `image` field to your post's frontmatter:

```markdown
---
title: "My Amazing Post"
description: "This post will have a great thumbnail"
date: "2024-01-21"
image: "/images/posts/my-post-hero.jpg"  # This creates the social preview!
---
```

When someone shares this post, they'll see:
- Your post title
- Description
- The featured image as a thumbnail
- Your site name

This works automatically across Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and other platforms!

## 📁 Adding Images to Posts

### Method 1: Local Images (Recommended)

**Step 1: Add Images to Public Folder**
```bash
# Create images directory
mkdir public/images
mkdir public/images/posts

# Add your image files here
```

**Step 2: Reference in Your Post**
```markdown
# My Tutorial

Here's a screenshot of the interface:

![Dashboard screenshot](/images/posts/dashboard.png)

You can add captions by putting text right after:

![Code example](/images/posts/code-snippet.png)
*Figure 1: Example of the component structure*
```

### Method 2: Multiple Images in Sequence

Perfect for tutorials and step-by-step guides:

```markdown
# Setting Up Your Environment

First, install the dependencies:

![NPM install command](/images/posts/npm-install.png)

Next, start the development server:

![Dev server running](/images/posts/dev-server.png)

Finally, open your browser:

![Application running](/images/posts/app-running.png)
```

### Method 3: Clickable Images

Make images clickable to show larger versions:

```markdown
# Project Screenshots

Click for full size:

[![Thumbnail](/images/posts/app-thumb.jpg)](/images/posts/app-fullsize.jpg)

Or link to external demos:

[![Demo preview](/images/posts/demo-preview.jpg)](https://your-demo-site.com)
```

## 🛠️ Image Best Practices

### File Organization
```
public/
├── images/
│   ├── posts/
│   │   ├── tutorial-setup/
│   │   │   ├── hero.jpg
│   │   │   ├── step1.png
│   │   │   └── final-result.jpg
│   │   └── project-showcase/
│   │       ├── preview.jpg
│   │       └── architecture.png
│   └── og-images/
│       └── default-og.jpg
```

### Naming Convention
- **Descriptive names**: `react-component-diagram.png` not `image1.png`
- **Lowercase with hyphens**: `my-project-screenshot.jpg`
- **Organized by post**: `tutorial-react-basics-step1.png`

### Image Optimization

**Resize before uploading**:
- **Hero/featured images**: 1200px wide max
- **Content images**: 800px wide max
- **File size**: Keep under 500KB each

**Use the right format**:
- **JPG**: Photos, complex images
- **PNG**: Screenshots, graphics with transparency
- **WebP**: Modern format, smaller sizes (when supported)

**Optimization tools**:
- [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) - Online compression
- [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/) - Google's image optimizer
- [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/) - Mac app

## 🎨 Advanced Image Features

### Responsive Images

Images automatically resize on mobile, but you can add custom styling:

```markdown
![Large diagram](/images/posts/system-architecture.png)

<img 
  src="/images/posts/mobile-optimized.png" 
  alt="Mobile interface" 
  style="max-width: 300px; margin: 0 auto; display: block;"
/>
```

### Image Galleries

Create simple galleries with multiple images:

```markdown
## Project Screenshots

![Desktop view](/images/posts/desktop.jpg) ![Mobile view](/images/posts/mobile.jpg)

![Dark mode](/images/posts/dark-mode.jpg) ![Light mode](/images/posts/light-mode.jpg)
```

## 🌐 External Images

You can also use external images (though local is better for performance):

```markdown
![Placeholder image](https://via.placeholder.com/600x300/0066cc/ffffff?text=Sample+Image)

![GitHub avatar](https://github.com/yourusername.png)

![Unsplash photo](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1234567890)
```

## 🔍 SEO Benefits

Using images properly helps with SEO:

1. **Alt text** helps screen readers and search engines
2. **Featured images** increase social media engagement
3. **Optimized file sizes** improve page load speed
4. **Descriptive filenames** help with image search rankings

## 📱 Complete Example

Here's a real blog post example with images:

```markdown
---
title: "Building My Portfolio Website"
description: "How I designed and built my personal portfolio from scratch"
date: "2024-01-21"
tags: ["portfolio", "design", "development"]
categories: ["projects"]
featured: true
image: "/images/posts/portfolio/hero.jpg"
---

# Building My Portfolio Website

I recently redesigned my portfolio and wanted to share the process!

![Portfolio homepage](/images/posts/portfolio/homepage.jpg)
*The new homepage design*

## Design Process

I started with wireframes:

![Initial wireframes](/images/posts/portfolio/wireframes.png)

Then moved to high-fidelity mockups:

## Development

The tech stack I chose:
